Getting and Cleaning Data: Course Project
=========================================

Introduction
------------
This repository contains my work for the course project for the Coursera course "Getting and Cleaning data", part of the Data Science specialization.


About the script and the tidy dataset
-------------------------------------
I created a script called run_analysis.R which will merge the test and training sets together, gonna take the columns with titles containing the "mean" and "Std" words, after that, create a dataframe just with this columns.

Finally, the script will create a tidiData2 set containing the means of all the columns per test subject and per activity.
The output will be two files with both data sets.
